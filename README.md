Dear SyncVR team!

Thank you for your assessment! It was a big pleasure to work on this project!

As mentioned in the task, I need to write below some sound design solutions I have made:

- Completed the requirements of the assessment in the specific Unity version 2020.3.18f1;
- All sounds you can find in the “/ProjectWindow/Assets/Audio/AudioAssets” folder;
- Composed the orchestral music;
- Recorded forest sound for “ForestDay”;
- Reversed and added reverb with delay for “ForestNight”;
- Created “mystic” sound for Ruins Ambiance;
- Recorded all footsteps and jumps;
- Using C# to extend the quantity of jump sounds to array (in script “Character Audio”);
- Added the new prefab “Fire” in the “/ProjectWindow/Assets/Audio/Prefab” folder. It is a “torch” at Ruins ambiance. There are three of them. Sound is also recorded;
- I didn’t find a ready option to implement the sound of “Sequence” so I decided to do it with a script. I created the “Sequence Audio” script. You can find it in “ProjectWindow/Assets/Scripts”. I connected it with the “GameplayTrigger” script to make it work properly using the function “PlayMagicSound()”;
- I created the sound of Sequence with attention to any animation event;
- I made a ducking effect between Sequence Aux and Music with Ambiance Auxes so it is possible now to hear clearly the Sequence Audio;
- Created UI sound in the main key of music so it sounds now like one unity.
- I didn't make the files compression so now the project's size is "856 186 193 bytes (921,1 MB on disk) for 22 701 items". I understand that for a real project it isn't appropriate. But at least for assessment and regarding task details I consider it as an admissible case. Anyway, you can familiarize yourself with the sounds in good quality (SR 44100; 16 bit)

It would be great to get feedback in a nutshell!
Thank you for your time! I look forward to hearing from you! 

Kind regards, 
Bohdan Reshetilov
